- a personal interest site (song/ playlist recommendations)
  - song recommended for the day?
  - somehow relate it to a calender? song + image + calender combination
  - or just an archive of songs categorized differently
    - with the color of its album color
    - with the mood of the song
    - with the language of the song
    - with the genre of the song
    - with a set of photos taken by me -> each photo is linked to a song that matches with it
    
Still working on layout and style for either direction...
