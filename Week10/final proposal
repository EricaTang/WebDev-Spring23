- I plan to create a website of a gallery of photos Iâ€™ve taken in different places and adding some sort of sound or music.
- This will be an extension of the photography section of my portfolio website, so the aesthetics and style will be similar
  - minimalistic style
  - bold fonts & color
- I would be using Bootstrap and some JS

Here are some websites that gave me inspiration on the aesthetics:
